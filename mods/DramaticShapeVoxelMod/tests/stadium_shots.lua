-- Driver: screenshot a STADIUM battle -- the 3D-BTL row's third rung, where
-- the two Pokemon are the Pokemon Stadium battle models rather than the
-- game's own pics stood up on their tiles.
--
-- What has to be looked at is a SPREAD OF SPECIES, because almost everything
-- that can go wrong here is per-model: how big it comes out (the size ladder
-- compresses a sixteenfold spread of authored heights -- see StadiumMon),
-- whether its feet are on the ground (the floor rule has to tell a hovering
-- Zubat from a Tentacruel centred on its own origin), whether the eyes
-- animate, and whether the species carries generated flame prims. So the
-- list below is deliberately awkward: the smallest and the largest in the
-- set, a hoverer, a floater, and the two species whose idle animation is
-- known to be wrong in the source data.
