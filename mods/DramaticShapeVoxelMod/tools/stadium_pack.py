"""Pack the Pokemon Stadium battle models into the mod's own .dsm format.

    tools/stadium_pack.py [--rom=PATH] [--out=assets/stadium]
                          [--only=25,6] [--report]

Reads the ROM directly, through model_extract/pipeline -- the same modules,
in the same order, that lib/StadiumRom.lua and lib/StadiumFragment.lua port to
Lua so the mod can do this itself at runtime with no Python and no checked-in
extract.  That parallel is the point of this tool now: it is the ORACLE the
Lua extractor is verified against (tests/stadium_extract_test.lua diffs all
151 files byte for byte), so anything that changes the bytes has to change on
both sides or the suite says so.

The output is one file per species, `NNN.dsm`, holding geometry, the bone
tree, every animation, the textures and the battle system's own slot tables
(which animation each move plays, and which one each battle context asks
for).  Nothing here is decoded at runtime beyond byte order: lib/
StadiumPack.lua walks these files straight into arrays.

Textures are stored as RAW RGBA8 rather than PNG, which is why the magic is
DSM3.  Two reasons, and the second is the one that decided it.  A PNG costs a
decode on the frame a battle starts, where an ImageData over the bytes costs
nothing.  And PNG means zlib: Python's deflate and LOVE's are both valid and
need not agree byte for byte, so a packed PNG would make this file impossible
to check the Lua extractor against.  Uncompressed pixels are the same pixels
whoever wrote them.

Everything is little-endian, so the reader's byte pairs go (low, high).
