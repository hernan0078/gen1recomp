-- Voxel world mode: the 3D pass -- shader, depth buffer and camera.
--
-- World space is world PIXELS, so every coordinate the 2D paths already
-- compute drops straight in with no unit conversion:
--
--   +X  map east   (world-pixel x)
--   +Y  up         (0 is the ground plane)
--   +Z  map south  (world-pixel y)
--
-- A character at rest faces +Z, i.e. toward a camera parked to the south,
-- which is what "facing down" means in the 2D game -- and a character card
-- is drawn in exactly that pose, leaning back rather than yawing.
--
-- The camera orbits the view centre at Voxel.angle: 0 is straight down
-- (what the flat 2D view already is) and 50 degrees leans toward the
-- horizon. Distance and field of view are tied to Voxel.FOCAL, which is the
-- same constant Tilt projects with, so a given angle frames the world
-- identically in both modes -- switching between them changes the geometry,
-- not the framing.
--
-- Every GPU object is pcall-guarded and `available()` reports the result:
-- headless test runs and any driver without depth-canvas support fall back
-- to the existing tilt/flat paths rather than erroring.

-- Draw a character AGAIN wherever the ordinary draw LOST the depth test.
--
-- Honest occlusion is the point of this mode -- walk behind the Mart and the
-- Mart is genuinely in front of you -- but a player who cannot see their own
-- character has lost track of where they are standing, which the flat game
-- never allowed. So the figure is drawn a second time with the test
-- INVERTED: "greater" passes exactly where "lequal" failed, and LOVE hands
-- the compare straight to glDepthFunc, so the two are true complements.
-- Every texel of the sprite is therefore drawn once and once only -- solid
-- where it is visible, translucent where it is not -- with no seam where
-- they meet and no double-blending anywhere.
--
-- Nothing is drawn at all when nothing is in the way, and no code here ever
-- asks whether the player is occluded: the depth buffer already knows, and
-- the test is the question.
--
-- Depth WRITES are off. This pass is behind the scenery by definition, and
-- writing would file the hidden figure's depth in front of the building
-- hiding it -- the grass pass at the end of the frame reads that buffer.
--
-- The caller redraws through the ordinary character path, so the ghost keeps
-- the same mesh, matrix and camera-ward PULL as the real draw. The pull
-- matching is what keeps the leaning-over-a-near-wall case out of here: pull
-- already won that fight for the solid draw, so this pass finds nothing left
-- to paint and a character merely standing close to a wall does not shimmer
-- a ghost over it.

-- lookup transform a lit slab reads its own shadowing with (Voxel3D.draw's
-- `sunModel`): it collapses the slab's side relief onto the card plane, so
-- every vertex asks about the exact surface the sun recorded rather than
-- one a few pixels behind it, and a figure cannot fringe itself. On the
