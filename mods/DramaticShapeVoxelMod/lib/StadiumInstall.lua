-- STADIUM battles: finding the ROM, and building the models out of it once.
--
-- The mod does not ship the Pokemon Stadium models and cannot: they are that
-- game's data. What it ships is the READER -- StadiumRom, StadiumFragment,
-- StadiumFx and StadiumBuild -- and the player supplies the cartridge, which
-- is exactly the arrangement this engine already has for the Game Boy ROM it
-- is a recompilation of (src/import/RomImporter.lua).
--
-- So: supply a Pokemon Stadium (US) 1.0 ROM -- the OPTIONS row opens a file
-- picker for one, or drop it in `baseroms/` -- and the first time the
-- game runs with the mod on, the models are built. Once, on a loading screen,
-- in about ten seconds. After that the packs sit in the save directory and
-- the mod reads them like any other asset.
--
-- ------- where "baseroms/" is
--
-- One relative path, and it deliberately covers two different places at once,
-- because PhysFS searches the save directory AND the game folder under the
-- same names:
--
--   * a folder install, or a checkout -- `baseroms/` next to main.lua
--   * a packaged or fused build, where the game folder is inside an archive
--     and cannot be written to -- `baseroms/` in the save directory, whose
--     absolute path this reports on screen so it can be found
--
-- The file goes STRAIGHT IN THERE, with no revision subfolder under it. The
-- decompilation's own `make init` uses `baseroms/us/`, and the offline
-- pipeline under model_extract/ still reads from there because it shares that
-- tree -- but the instruction given to a player is "drop the file in this
-- folder", and one folder is the whole of it.
--
-- Any of `.z64`, `.n64` and `.v64` is accepted; StadiumRom normalises the
-- byte order on load.
--
-- ------- what "installed" means
--
-- A marker file next to the packs, holding the format magic, how many species
-- were written and the md5 of the ROM they came from. All three matter. The
-- magic catches a format change (the packs are rebuilt rather than read as
-- garbage), the count catches a build that was interrupted half way, and the
-- md5 catches the player swapping the ROM for a different revision.

-- the mod namespace (see main.lua): V.require loads a sibling module

-- Bumped when the packs' CONTENT changes without the byte layout moving, so
-- a cache built by an older extractor is rebuilt rather than trusted. Rev 2
-- is the hermite-animation decode fix: the five keyframe species (Pidgeot,
-- Dodrio, Exeggutor, Tangela, Magmar) come out garbled or bind-posed from
-- any rev-1 build.

-- Named ROM files, then any ROM at all sitting in the folder.
--
-- Flat in `baseroms/`, with no revision subfolder: the offline pipeline under
-- model_extract/ keeps the decompilation's own `baseroms/us/` convention
-- because it shares that tree, but what is being asked of a PLAYER here is
-- "drop the file in this folder", and one folder is the whole of that
-- instruction. A path they have to build out of two parts is a path half of
-- them will get wrong, and the failure is silent -- the rungs are simply not
-- on the row.
