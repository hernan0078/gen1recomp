-- Voxel world mode: the sun's own pass -- a real shadow map.
--
-- The old drop shadows were decals: each character's sprite frame squashed
-- flat onto the ground plane it stood on. That can only ever paint the
-- FLOOR, so a shadow stopped dead at the foot of a wall, and nothing but a
-- character cast one at all -- buildings, trees, signs and ledges threw
-- nothing.
--
-- So render the scene once from the sun instead. An orthographic camera
-- pointed down the sun line stores, per texel, how far the light travelled
-- before it hit something; the main pass transforms each fragment into that
-- same space and asks whether anything got there first. What the sun cannot
-- see is in shadow, whatever surface it happens to be -- so a shadow climbs
-- a wall, drapes over a roof and slides across a passing NPC without a
-- single case in the code, and every caster is simply whatever the pass
-- draws: the terrain mesh (buildings, trees, ledges, props -- all of it)
-- plus one upright card per character.
--
-- Depth is stored in an ORDINARY color canvas, packed into two 8-bit
-- channels (~16 bits over the frustum, well under a tenth of a world
-- pixel). A readable depth texture would be tidier, but depth sampling is
-- the least portable corner of the graphics API and this mod's whole
-- contract is that an unsupported driver falls back rather than errors --
-- everything here is pcall-guarded and `available()` reports the result,
-- with VoxelScene dropping back to the flat decal shadows when it says no.

-- The sun, as the shear a shadow takes: a point `y` world-pixels above the
-- ground drops its shadow (KX*y, KZ*y) away from the point under it. Both
-- negative hangs the sun in the SOUTHEAST, so every shadow falls northwest
-- -- up and to the left on screen, since the camera puts north at the top
-- and east to the right at every tilt.
--
-- Their MAGNITUDE is how low the sun sits: hypot(KX, KZ) = 1.01 puts it
-- about 45 degrees up, so a 16px character throws a shadow about as long
-- as it is tall -- against the 62-degree noon these started at, which read
-- as a smudge under everybody's feet.
--
-- Their RATIO is the compass bearing, and it leans WEST of northwest on
-- purpose. A character is drawn as a slab leaning back away from the
-- camera, which covers the ground directly north of its feet -- so a
-- shadow thrown due north lands entirely underneath the figure casting it
-- and is never seen. At 0.85 west the shadow reaches 13px out against the
-- sprite's own 8px half-width, so it clears the slab and reads, while 0.55
-- north still puts it a clear 23 degrees up from horizontal on screen.

-- the light frustum is sized to the WORLD VIEW and that swings by 3x
-- between the closest zoom and a maximised window at the widest. A fixed
-- edge is either wasteful at one end or a blur at the other.
--
-- TARGET is the world pixels per texel worth paying for: at a third of a
-- pixel a shadow edge lands inside the pixel grid this whole mode exists
-- to keep crisp, and finer buys nothing the grid can show. The smallest
-- size that meets it wins, and the ladder tops out at 2048 (16 MB, and the
